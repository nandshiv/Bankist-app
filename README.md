# Bankist App 💰

A fictional online banking interface built as part of my JavaScript learning journey. This project was created while following along with Jonas Schmedtmann’s JavaScript course on Udemy.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is not my original project. It was developed by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) as part of his Udemy course: *"The Complete JavaScript Course."*  
> I followed along, wrote the code myself, and used it as a practical way to solidify core JavaScript concepts.
